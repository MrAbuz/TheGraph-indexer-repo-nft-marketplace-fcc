What we've did so far to setup The Graph:

Creating a subgraph on the The Graph website
All the stuff in the beginning of installing cli, and initializing that we have the commands in the website
Downloaded the graphql extension that is on github
Updated the schema.graphql
Called "graph codegen" after we updated the schema.graphql
And now we're updating the "nft-marketplace.ts" file from the "src" folder
